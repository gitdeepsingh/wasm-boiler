  "description": "#### - Features: ##### 1. WASM is statically compiled and is bytecode, hence very fast. Has few compilation steps. ##### 2. It has very small code codebase, hence transportable. ##### 3. It is easily operable with JS. Both can interact with each other's ecosystem. ##### 4. Being low-level, other codes like C, Rust etc. can be compiled into WASM. Great to migrate legacy codebases. ##### 5. Very secure, runs on a sandbox env. Therefore by default, it has no access to the file system on your machine. We can give permissions regarding the access. ##### 6. All these features make it suitable for backend codes as well ex: blockchains (may be an alternative to docker containers later).",
